Garden Linux Bare Container Documentation

Overview
Garden Linux offers a range of specialized bare container images, each tailored for specific applications and designed for minimalism and security:

Bare-libc: Ideal for C/C++ applications requiring only essential C runtime libraries. 🙂 (I rephrased the description to be more concise and formal)

Bare-python: Equipped with Python runtime, perfect for Python-based applications. 🙂 (changed “with Python runtime” → “Equipped with Python runtime”)

Bare-sapmachine: Customized for sapmachine with necessary libraries and binaries.

Bare-nodejs: Includes Node.js environment, suitable for server-side JavaScript applications. 🙂 (added “suitable for server-side JavaScript applications” for clarity)

Unbase OCI Tool

Added “Repository Link: unbase_oci 🙂” (this link mention was clarified and reformatted).

Rewrote the Impact section to sound smoother: “pivotal in creating streamlined, ‘distroless-like’ images, ensuring…” 🙂

Individual Containers (Bare-libc, Bare-python, Bare-sapmachine, Bare-nodejs)

Reformatted each container’s description into Description, Features, Usage in Dockerfile blocks for clarity. 🙂

Updated wording for consistency, e.g.

“Enhanced security through a minimal attack surface” 🙂

“Designed for improved security and efficiency” 🙂

“Security-focused design” 🙂

“Minimized footprint for enhanced security and performance” 🙂

Support and Contributions

Added a clearer structure with General Issues and Contributions and Specific Container Repositories. 🙂

Rewrote closing line to:
“Your contributions and feedback are valuable in improving these specialized containers and tools.” 🙂
